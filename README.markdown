planet-wars-haskell
===================

Unofficial Haskell starter package for
[the google ai contest](http://ai-contest.com).

Usage
-----

The [PlanetWars](http://github.com/jaspervdj/planet-wars-haskell/blob/master/PlanetWars.hs)
module contains a small library to build your bot on. The
[Main](http://github.com/jaspervdj/planet-wars-haskell/blob/master/Main.hs)
module contains a simple example bot, based on the example in the C++ starter
package.

You should change the `Main` module to your liking. If you make any improvements
to the `PlanetWars` module, I would appreciate if you have me pull your changes,
so everyone can benefit from your improvements -- after all, we're trying to get
the Haskell bots as high as possible in the ranking, right?
