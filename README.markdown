planet-wars-haskell
===================

Unofficial Haskell starter package for
[the google ai contest](http://ai-contest.com).

Usage
-----

The [PlanetWars](http://github.com/jaspervdj/planet-wars-haskell/blob/master/PlanetWars.hs)
module contains a small library to build your bot on. The
[MyBot](http://github.com/jaspervdj/planet-wars-haskell/blob/master/MyBot.hs)
module contains a simple example bot, based on the example in the C++ starter
package.

You should change the `MyBot` module to your liking. If you make any
improvements to the `PlanetWars` module, I would appreciate if you have me pull
your changes, so everyone can benefit from your improvements -- after all, we're
trying to get the Haskell bots as high as possible in the ranking, right?
